Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3571,my friend and i wanted to catch up over dinner on a saturday evening and she picked this place as she read great reviews we didnt have a reservation so we waited in line and the friendly staff at the front took down one of our names then we were informed that it would be about  minute wait and were asked to wait until our name was called while waiting we looked around the vibe was energetic and fun the customers were eating and laughing the decor was cool the lights were dimmed there were various colourful objects all around to evoke a comfy feel i thought the place was pretty small until our name was called and we were led to a table by a friendly young lady the place was huge there were multiple sections and each section had its own decor our seat was at the end section where the decor reminded us of sitting inside someones home our server was a second friendly young lady she warmly greeted us and showed us the menu qr code she said shell be back to take our order in a few minutes to start we ordered shrimp chips and two thai ice tea for the main i picked chef nuit pad thai with chicken my friend chose khao soi with beef a few minutes later the shrimp chips and two thai ice tea came to us the shrimp chips were delicious they were crispy and lightly salty the thai ice tea was tasty it tasted like milk tea with deeper tea flavour then our mains came and we couldnt wait to eat for my meal the blend of veggies chewy noodles and the chicken pieces were delicious however it was a bit salty my friend enjoyed her meal as well she said that she liked the smooth coconut curry with blend of spices and the juicy pieces of beef throughout our meal our server came by to checkin on us to make sure that we had everything we needed the portions were generous and the dishes and drinks were delicious highly recommended,Maria J.,5

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3571,my friend loves this restaurant me well its just ok for me  way too crowded inside people waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience  we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience host said no chance to switch to a regular table very uncomfortable no where to put our coats purses our feet just dangled  we ordered pork skewers as app very tasty curry dish came with rice that was good we also ordered pad thai which was also good the other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg it was just ok for me  i noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm i like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served  order thai spicy our food was not spicy at alleven tho we ordered our dishes spicyon the positive side the server was gooddont know if i would return,Becky G.,3

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3571,friday night dinner tried to book  weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations they have limited reservations available to welcome more walkin guests so took a chance and waited in line to get a table seated in  mins already a long line up in front of the restaurant around pm this michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eatin area an exciting vibe with full of energy  we are group of  orderedfood  thai chicken wings grabong buttercup squash fritters  moo ping grilled pork skewers gaeng kiaw wan  green curry chicken  gaeng massaman beef pad see ew shrimphighlight was pad see ew loved the wide flat noodle great texture with chewiness and tenderness the wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan chinese broccoli the presentation of the green curry was impressive  the curry was in the coconut shell tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat rich in textures and flavors the accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed wrapped in a leaf flavorful compared to the amount of the curry i wished the size of the rice were bigger you can order the rice separately for  sweet with mild spice kick the wings pork skewers massaman curry and grabong all tasted great nothing to complain about but nothing to note as wow     drinks cocktails goji anunoby vodka grande marnier domain de canton plum wineplum bitters goji pop tea goji berries thai mojito white rum lemongrass syrup fresh basil lime topped with soda and butterfly pea flower red pai sangria malbec grand marnier lychees fresh pineapple pomegranate juice limeall the cocktails had unique thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices fruits everything hit a good balance of sour and exotic scent and fruitiness they all maintained nice boozy kick the amount of food were perfect for  adults will come back,Aiko I.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3571,hubby and i saw this place on youtubes worth it and we were curious and had to try this place out is it all hype or is it worth iti loved the mango slaw as i found it refreshing i loved the textures of the sweetness of the mangos with the crunchiness of the taro sticks and peanuts it is a must get in my book hubby and i decided to go vegetarian for our entrees hubby ordered tofu pad gra prow which was very good while i ordered tofu khao soi there was a perfect balance between the curry and soup the harmonious coconut milk with the stock made it the standout dish with its refreshing combination of flavors and textures i truly appreciate the notion that they offer plenty of vegetarian food and can make any dish vegan this is a trendy place and you should make reservations on friday nights as well as the weekends the service was fast and efficient they offer dinner specials but the waitress explained everyone at the table would have to order it in order for it to come into effect the ambiance with live bands on weekends and the overall trendy atmosphere adds an extra layer of enjoyment to the dining experience  so the question remains is it worth it the answer is unequivocally yes it definitely lived up to the hype for us,Brenda C.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3571,we went here on a thursday to get in line around am this restaurant doesnt open until pm and there was already a line before it openedwe got the gaeng massaman chef built pad thai and thai chicken wings i also wanted to order dessert too but they dont serve dessert until after pm so i only ended up getting those food items anyways all the food was good but it wasnt the best thai food ive had the food were very average in flavor the thai chicken wings were my favorite part though those chicken wings were covered were crispy well marinated and juicyanother positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad thai we shared the pad thai and that made us full the gaeng massaman curry dish we got was good too and i liked how the curry wasnt too thickid recommend this place but maybe only during their dinner hours i recommend to come during the dinner hours because then youll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too i also wish this place had more variety of food items since it didnt feel like much variety when i went,Elaine N.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3571,i was in toronto attending the annual tiff film festival and dined at this restaurant on my birthday i wanted a nice meal and a break from all the movies and the large crowd hanging around out front and the hourlong wait for a table reassured me that this was going to be a tasty meal i put my name on the list and waited for a text that my table was ready the hostess asked if we would be okay sitting at a communal table so be aware if youre super private and would prefer to dine alone the restaurant is in a basement so its very dark and intimate inside it is packed with tables so youll run a gauntlet to get to your table the atmosphere is casual and lively and its very loud inside with concrete floors and walls the decor is casual and fun with colorful flags adorning the walls and a large bar in the centersince it was my birthday we decided to order a bottle of prosecco that was listed on the menu the friendly server took that order and disappeared only to return to say they didnt have any bottles of prosecco and wed have to order by the glass big disappointment we placed our order for thai vegetables as an appetizer and we each got their house specialty pad thai i chose shrimp my husband chose beef our server typed our orders into his electronic pad and disappeared for the remainder of our meal the place was packed and they obviously didnt have enough servers waiting tables so the service knocks this place down at least one but probably two stars another thing that really bugged me is that we were charged prices that were higher than what was stated on the menu i am not sure if this was just the tourist surprise special or if they have dynamic pricing during special events downtown but it rubbed me the wrong way my prosecco perglass price was almost three dollars more than listed on the menu as were our entrees not cool  i also was annoyed by the volume of noise in the place it was so loud with people screaming to have conversations this wouldve been a killer place for a romantic evening if they could do something about the noise levels the food was really good and made with high quality ingredients so i cant complain about that at all in fact ill definitely return next time im in town for the festival note they wont take reservations during tiff so dont bother but do show up at least an hour before you want to eat it really did take the quoted time for a table to be ready,Louisa M.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3571,pai is one of the most popular goto places lots of locals recommend a lot coming into this i had some expectations that itll live up to the hype unfortunately i found the place a bit overhyped and not mindblowing pad thai quite average pad thai it wasnt bad but wasnt really the best pad thai ive had especially since its a reasonably high price pointpapaya salad  mango salad the papaya salad came with shrimp chips and vermicelli the mango salad had low quantity of mango was mostly carrots was a bit too much msg on the salad seasoning khao soi the better dish out of all of them the broth was flavourful and creamy everything went well together would recommend only getting this and perhaps their curry dishes as it seems like thats their specialty overall i had much better expectations for this spot and disappointed that pai doesnt live up to the hype they receive although i will give them credit they have an extensive menu which may be good for groups that have a lot of dietary restrictions its not worth the long wait over  mins wait time or far in advanced reservations in my opinion,Cindy N.,3
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3571,the place was decorated really well with a tropical theme it was about an hour wait for our party of  on a rainy wednesday evening in november the waiting area is very small most of my family had to stand i ordered the chaing mai beef noodle soup they give you a good amount of meat and it was very flavorful i tried my boyfriends khao soi chicken and noodles in coconut milk curry and it was so creamy it the best thing i had eaten all month i recommend dining here and definitely make a reservation ahead of time,Sandra K.,4
Pho Friendly 18,40,pho on a cold winter day is a no brainer glad we came across this little gem from the outside i expected it to be small and dark but as you step in its exactly the opposite spacious and bright enough all cart seats with tall head boards ie great for covid times imo my table had a disinfectant wipe bottle for quick use quick scan a few other tables did too staff was nice too on a random monday afternoon it was pretty busy for a hidden restaurant we sat down for  mins and every  mins there would be new customers or getting take out that was a good sign to us that we were hitting a spot  food wise it was solid good portions with generous amount of meat  and well grilled meats we got medium pho thuc p   another pho place we know has slightly better broth beef wrap and grilled pork vermicelli  and fresh roll shrimp pork   pork was a bit dry here will come again,Annie L.,5
Pho Friendly 18,40,attitude is an important factor in the work environment im a tourist from the us went to this restaurant once and personally i dont like the way the owners treats their staffs the food is bland not as my expectation no better than other restaurants i tried asking the staff whether i can directly give them tips or not  the answer is no because the owner will take it all moreover during working hours even if the restaurant has no customers they will not be allowed to sit in my opinion that is very bad shop owners should reconsider their attitude if they want to have dedicated employees in the future,Khanhh D.,1
Pho Friendly 18,40,was in the area and decided to try this spot for dinner we were intrigued by the menu which has some interesting dishes that you dont often find in the east end of the gta we got a pork chopshrimp in bean curdfried egg rice and a vermicelli dish with grilled pork belly and fried tofuthe rice dish was pretty average but the shrimp paste in bean curd was really disappointing we thought it was undercooked because the texture was mushy like wet bread and the waitress explained that it was in fact cooked but they had an issue with the supplier she went on to say that other customers throughout the day had been complaining as well im sympathetic to their supply issues but wasnt sure what that explanation did for me in terms of still being served a food that they knew was inedible and problematic there was some reluctance to offer any kind of solution but she comped the dish which i appreciatethe vermicelli dish b was pretty good in terms of flavour and came with lots of fresh herbs and green but we found the thinly sliced pork belly to be a bit overcooked and tough the menu also said it comes with shrimp paste which is partly why i ordered it but when it never came and when i asked the server she said it doesnt come with it and didnt give us anyoverall a rather disappointing and forgettable meal,Tiffany W.,2
Pho Friendly 18,40,we came here on a sunday for lunch we came as a family of  which includes  young children the restaurant itself was very family friendly they also gave kits of boosters and we did notice kits of other families around we ordered a rice dish noodle dish and fresh spring rolls and the food was delicious and very affordable especially for the size we spent  for everything highly recommend,Jessica C.,4
Pho Friendly 18,40,pho friendly s name begs just one question are there  predecessors i looked it up to confirm there were none  or might they be as stealthy as  thats located in a nondescript industrial plaza near vaughan mills wo much signage i assume its fairly authentic as this cavernous pho spot is still fairly packedwe have a ton of pho options nearby and were curious to try pho friendly  the house special beef rice noodle soup has the typical assortment of thin beef cuts tripe tendon  beef balls along w a heap of garnishes bean sprouts basil lemongrass lime  hot pepper the relatively dark beef broth is quite strong in umami flavour they dont seem to hold back on good ol msg  salt still overall a large bowl is very filling  decent valuegrilled pork on vermicelli hit the spot with a faint bbq char on the edges of the thin marinated pork pieces bun rieu noodle bowl however was a bit disappointing it contained mainly tofu  ham slices in tomato noodle soup but no meatballs or truly distinguishing flavour shrimp  pork fresh roll is fairly light in protein among its stuffing luckily the hoisin peanut dipping sauce helps to devour the roll pho friendly  serves up decent flavours in its staple pho  grilled dishes our takeout was wellpacked but star is docked as i went to pickup for a family member and wasnt directed to take both bags from the table usually places are careful with these handoffs i drove back from home for the second portion no apologies so perhaps theyre not always that friendly,Mike H.,3
Pho Friendly 18,40,was researching vietnam place around vaughan mills and came upon this place in the yelp reviews lots of parking in the commercial plaza on the weekend  food and service was great also has big wall hung tv and available wifithe nam vang rice noodle we got had so much ingredients compared with the ratio of noodles quite satisfying also the soup base was unique tasted a bit salty but was not thirsty afterward equals good soup  the grilled chicken sugar cane shrimp and spring roll was good shrimp very bouncy teeth the spring roll was avg thou  if you in the area give it a try,Mugendd P.,3
Pho Friendly 18,40,supper friendly staff this is hands down my favorite pho place theyre super clean and the meats and veggies are so fresh i drive all the way from markham to have pho here if that isnt saying something then i dont know what to say,Wendy L.,5
Pho Friendly 18,40,this place obviously does not want to do business i have never written a food review before to pho unfriendly  all i can say is  change your attitude managerowner have the decency to help out your employee  treat customers with due respect  clearly write out the receipts instead of a lump sum on the receipt especially when you are charging service charge on top of tip without notifying customers  let the customer know if part of the meal is still coming folks do not i repeat do not be swayed by its name this place is anything but friendly while we noticed there were only less than a handful of tables sitted during peak lunch hours we decided to try it out and help out a local business we sat down  ordered food one singular dish came out in separate lengthy intervals we thought wow this dish is hella expensive for the sheer amount we finished it and after half an hour the part two of a singular dish came out that we had already finished what well okwhile there were less than a handful of tables occupied we understood from the time they took so we only asked for the bare minimum a serving spoon that was missing in order to eat the dish  a singular teapot refill after finishing the meal we decided to go up to the counter to make it easier for the singular female server who was also the cashier and the managerowner who does not do anything to pay the bill came in one lump sum with no clear indication of the prices distribution dish tax etc we paid yet something wasnt right thanks to our asian math we were able to calculate with a menu that we definitely paid more we spoke to the female servercashier  she was quite nice about it however the manager finally did something honestly thought he mightve been part of the restaurant or something spoke rudely to us after quite some time of trying just to understand what they charged us the manager begrudgingly said it was an extra service charge on top of tips that only our table was made to pay  no other table this is the what the heck part because we asked too much wow what a character let me remind you all we asked was for a missing serving spoon  a single teapot refillsigh never again,Priscilla M.,1
Pho Friendly 18,40,enjoyed the food the service was great people were nice quiet but definitely got busy around dinner time lots of parking its a little out of the way for me but will come back if i am in the area,Mich C.,4
Pho Friendly 18,40,love this place had our first lunch after the lifting of the lockdown it was my first time here so happy my friend suggested this place it was delicious loved their spring rolls they were the real authentic ones wrapped in rice paper crunchy and bubbly crispy just the way i like it  the only thing missing was lettuce to wrap the rolls in the spring roll came with a bit of vermicelli and pickled carrots and radish had a small pho with rare beef tendons and beef balls the tendons were soooo good perfect tenderness everything was delicious cant wait to go back and try everything else if i werent so far from this place id go all the time,Maggie Y.,4

Kathmandu Restaurant,68,went for the winterlicious menu and was quite disappointed we ordered for appetizers the chicken and veggie momas they came out after  hour wait hot but the fried were greasy and the steamed were also oily and no flavor for the mains i ordered the shrimp and the others had the paneer all orders came to the table cold surprisingly as they are done in a tandoori oven there were only  tables occupied in the place but the staff were more interested in the skip and uber orders selection for the price was poor,Bradley B.,2
Kathmandu Restaurant,68,good food and service ambiance is relaxing started with momos and had butter chicken aloo gobi  naan for mains will definitely recommend others to visit,Patio B.,5
Kathmandu Restaurant,68,delicious food great serving sizes very filling and the service was quick and professional some of the best indian food ive ever had one thing id change is the fact that you have to pay for rice on the side but other then that everything was fairly priced and amazing  recommend for dinner,Riley p.,5
Kathmandu Restaurant,68,came here for lunch with a few coworkers the friday before christmas kathmandu has a wide variety of alacarte dishes they offer  for those who arent so sure they do have a lunch buffet thats reasonable and quite popular among its patrons   our group however decided to go with the alacarte heres the breakdownlamb korma this was a delightful dish the gravy saved this dish as it went well with the tender pieces of lambmomos dumplings  ive had better outer skin was too thick was probably frozenchili chicken pretty good but again not really hakka style as ive been to one too many of them to know if its hakka stylebasmati rice great no issuesnaan same no issuesoverall the place was okay however next time i may try their buffet as it seemed to be the popular choice,Phillip S.,3
Kathmandu Restaurant,68, small pakoras  small onion bhajis  small samosa   before taxthe star is for the taste,Vidya D.,5
Kathmandu Restaurant,68,im always looking to try something different so i was intrigued when i saw that kathmandu offered himalayannepalese cuisine from what ive read and what my server told me its a blend of indian and tibetan influences i havent had that before and the buffet meant i got to try several different thingsthey offer a small buffet not too many choices there were some popular indian dishes including butter chicken goat curry chick peas basmati rice and naan im not sure im seeing the tibetan influences the butter chicken was a little sweeter than im used to is that the nepalese style the food tasted good but i felt like i missed something,Chris C.,3
Kathmandu Restaurant,68,great indian buffet with a ton of vegetarian options and freshly baked naan across from yongebloor station and has superb staffs,Phuong P.,5
Kathmandu Restaurant,68,great indian restaurant located close to yonge and bloor i have been here many times and the food is always really good and fresh the restaurant is not that big but they have plenty of dishes for their lunch buffet they usually have few meat dishes and about four veggie curries plus salad bar in the winter time they also have masala chai included in the lunch buffet i especially like their saag paneer and chana masala but also their veggie and zucchini dishes are so good the employees are very friendly too they recently raised their prices a bit but i think its still worth the price will be coming soon again,Sanita M.,5

EAT BKK Thai Kitchen & Bar,293,thai food is always my goto  ive been in love with eat bkk since the panderoni when im craving for noodles during covid i love how their portions are huge and still tasty usually big portions tend to be a little flavourless but this hits all the spots heres the pad see ew  pad thai  we had to take it home like half of it if youre wondering how huge the portion is food service ambiance ,Angeline T.,5
EAT BKK Thai Kitchen & Bar,293,im giving it a star rating instead of  because of its milk tea which was too sweet and overpowered the tea flavor the green curry was also a little too sweet for my taste but my friends enjoyed it a lot my favorites were the tom yum and pad thai i was glad that the tom yum was spicy and sour enough to satisfy my craving for authentic thai food i was pleasantly surprised when they gave us a  discount for paying in cash the total bill came to  cadperson including tax it was definitely worth it,Luisa T.,3

EAT BKK Thai Kitchen & Bar,293,went here on a sunday and overall would rate the place for the foodwe got the chicken massaman curry beef khao soi andpapaya salad the massaman curry was flavourful had lots of meat in it it was a pretty good curry but id say not my favourite massaman currybeef khao soi was good the flavours were boldpapaya salad was really good as well a little bit tangy due to the fish saucevinegar but still overall really goodthe service was good we were seated right away and food came right away ambiance was pretty cool as they had paintings on the wall and made you feel like you were transported to a restaurant in thailandwe got one thai iced tea as well which was good tasted like regular thai iced tea our bill in total was about  with tax and tip it is a little bit more expensive than wed like to pay for thai food for the taste but would still come back here if we are even in the area and we are craving thai food,Pat R.,4
EAT BKK Thai Kitchen & Bar,293,very hip and down to earth interior has a unique decor and gives off thailandstreet vibes they also have cool mural paintings location is a tad tight with limited seating areas however the food is great if youre craving thai food then this is the place for thai street food style cuisine servers are well trained and quite friendly i highly recommend if youre craving thai,Hannah C.,5
Soya Mandarin Kitchen,45,ive been here twice already and both times ive thoroughly enjoyed my meals homecooking would be the best way to describe their dishes because none of the food tastes overprocessed the variety of dishes on the menu can be a bit overwhelming but i would highly recommend the sweet and sour pork the dim sum dishes eggplant and egg tarts ive never tried egg tarts quite like theirs and they always come piping hot to the table the staff are super friendly and you can tell they care about the customers experience ill definitely be back here again and look forward to introducing more of my friends to this restaurant,Jenny X.,5
Soya Mandarin Kitchen,45,its a small but exquisite place featuring northern chinese cuisines with a few south china dish items on the menu the food was authentic and reminded me of homemandarin veggie trio  very similar to what i had during my high school years eggplant potatoes and green bell peppers chopped in chunks deepfried and then stirfried with the gravy very northern chinese stylemixed veggie braised tofu  this one surprised me the tofu was deepfried and then covered with gravy it was crispy like a snackcrispy pork loin in ginger sauce  had a sweet and sour taste the portion size was good and it was crispy on the outsideshredded pancake  pork  wasnt too happy about this one the shredded pancake was a bit too dry and hard it would have been nice if it had maintained moisture and soaked up the gravy there wasnt much pork in there eitherblack sesame sweet yolk buns  had a lot of salted egg yolk custard inside loved the texturefresh baked egg tart  yummy dessert the tart was flaky and the egg custard was smooththey have quite a good variety of drinks  creative cocktails and nonalcoholic selectionsthe service was wonderful the staff there were very attentive  they introduced us to the menus kept our water glasses filled and provided napkins very nicefood quality creativity consistency  drinks quality variety  ambience interior design cleanliness  service courtesy knowledge timeliness  value quality vs price  ,Jeslyn X.,5
Soya Mandarin Kitchen,45,casual chinese restaurant i came with my boyfriend so he can try peking duck at a smaller portion since they serve half sizes herethe service was slow even though it wasnt too busy the peking duck took quite some time to come out and i wish it came out when it was hot so it would be more crispy the duck was turning cold towards the end of our meal other than that it was good the spicy and sour soup was alright more spicy than sour in my opinion the shrimp hagao was fine but had chewier and thicker skin than other hargow ive had the egg tarts were delicious and is like portuguese style egg tarts but took a really long time to come out after our meal we finished our food ordered dessert and waited another  mins for it this would not be an issue if they told us in advance how long it would take we were about to leave the restaurant without it there was only one other table dining at that time because of the service i am rounding my review from  to  stars not sure if id be back but they seem to have good lunch dealslook out for their yelp check in and reservation freebiesconnect with me on instagram foodiesxto,Whitney Z.,3
Soya Mandarin Kitchen,45,i saw yore food it looks so delicious too me id like to try it someday mmmmmmmmmmmmm,Andy L.,5
Soya Mandarin Kitchen,45,i was really excited to try their food so i decided to go for their lunch special on the weekdaysi ordered the chicken rice and i was quite disappointed  the chicken felt rubbery and oily and the whole plate was so oily as well i expected better since this is one of their popular dishes however value wise it was worth it for how much food youre getting their lunch special also includes a spring roll which i think it was about  altogetherservice was quick and the ambiance was perfect for a friendly catchup nice looking patio too,Angeline T.,3
Soya Mandarin Kitchen,45,local spot that serves up classic asian flavors the hainanese chicken was a bit dry and the scallion sauce couldve used more flavor overall still solid the coconut rice was the highlight of the dish you could eat a plate of just the rice it was that good the custard tart was a bit too buttery to the point where you couldnt taste any other flavors the pastry had an amazing flakiness though overall a solid place to come to when youre craving homey flavors,Connie L.,4
Soya Mandarin Kitchen,45,last month we went downtown and stumbled upon a great restaurant without even doing any research  we were immediately drawn in by the beautiful decoration and lunch specials that caught our eye the prices were also very reasonable we ordered the hainanese chicken rice but it wasnt quite authentic and the chicken was a little dry and roasted tasting however i really enjoyed the seasoned rice we also tried the general tao chicken which tasted more like sweet and sour chicken and wasnt spicy  but their portions were very generous and even included egg tarts spring rolls and salad the spring rolls were crispy and delicious and they even had my favourite  portuguese egg tarts i saved it for last because the crispy flaky crust is my favourite part im sure it would taste even better if i heated it up at home  ive heard that their signature dish is the peking duck but its probably better to order it with a larger group of people im definitely planning to go back and try it next time,Teresa H.,4

Soya Mandarin Kitchen,45,weve been craving peking duck and decided to try it here we got the half peking duck set and were very impressed by it the duck was delicious and the vegetables were fresh we also got the crispy pork loin in ginger sauce and that was great as well the sauce had tons of flavour without being too sweet or having an overpowering ginger flavour however we found the soup dumplings a little disappointing when we bit into it we didnt really get any soup out of it and the texture wasnt exactly what we hoped for either weve had much better soup dumplings and probably wont order it here againfor dessert we got free egg tarts for making a reservation through yelp the crust was very buttery like puff pastry or croissant dough my partner has tried many egg tarts and said this was the best so that says a lot the staff here was friendly but the service was a bit slower than wed like we waited quite a while for the entrees and then had a lengthy wait at the end just for the egg tarts we loved the peking duck and will probably be here again the next time were craving it,Jake L.,4
Soya Mandarin Kitchen,45,soya is a chinese restaurant in the baldwin village it is a great spot for chinese lunches serving up dishes of all preferencessmoked duck breast app  a good amount of juicy tender duck breast cooked well and seasoned lightly so the smokey flavour came through they provided a i think selfmade hosin sauce that was not of my liking fortunately the duck breast was good on its own hainanese chicken rice  an untraditional take on this dish bone in hainan chicken with sour and spicy soup as opposed to the more traditional chicken broth  the chicken was cooked nicely such that it was tender and juicy the chicken was light on seasoning but came with the ginger scallion oil that was good on the chicken and rice the rice felt unseasoned as traditionally it would come chicken oil rice overall it was good but would only choose this if im looking for a more bland dishbbq pork chop rice  something a bit more impressive was the pork chop with omelette on rice the pork looked and tasted similar to that of a char siu egg was fried nicely to get the crispy edges and runny yolk inside pork was cooked well and did not come out dry  would come back for this after trying the other dishesegg tart  the lunch menu comes with vegetarian spring rolls and an egg tart the egg tart really finishes off the meals and makes me want to come back again the egg tart comes fresh from the oven so that the custard is convex the skin of the tart different from traditional flaky egg tarts whereas they are dry and pasty these egg tarts are super buttery definitely coming back to finish off a meal with thisjubilee tea  a delicious fruit warm tea with hints of peach and pear the price a bit steap for the amount you get but it is worth the first trybutter beer  feels like a root beer float safe yourself the  and get either the alcoholic version or jubilee tea,Aaron A.,5
Soya Mandarin Kitchen,45,i am a xiao long bao xlb enthusiast i only tried their xlb pork  har gow thus my review is quite limited also the order was for take out so excited to find a new place that has xlb on the menu their xlb had thicker skin but had a good amount of soup the size of the meat was appropriate for the room in the pocket the soup was a bit darker and stronger and lacked a depth of flavor yet overall ok note xlb is not their signature itemi also had har gow as i was hungry haha it was better than i expected no previous review about this item found met with whole plumpy shrimps which made me feel that this place knows how to treat seafood tobiko was sprinkled on top  that gave a nice popping texture the skin was not as smooth but did not fall apart and was not too starchy good it is close to my work i may visit here to explore more items,Aiko I.,4
